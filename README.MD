#  Monfera: Age of Magic

a game where theres a magical river where magical creatures named monferas are spawning with special abilitys,
the game only has a short prolouge rn cuz i dident have enough time to make the rest,
first you meet proffessor pawmont who tells you stuff, and then kai comes your rival right, and chalenges you to who ever first catches a monfera (he always wins)
the game mechanics are so bad, sorry
oh yea and i once forgot about commits.... and i kinda changed 315 files in one commit, SORRY Reviewing team please spare me.
